	- Name it a number to denote which level it is. Starting from level 0
	- Place at least 1 shoreLine.tscn scene into the level. Reshapw, resize accordingly. The gizmo should show where the turtles will disappear when they touch. Turtles will path towards the center of this gizmo
	- Create 2 Camera3Ds, a DirectionalLight3D, and WorldEnvironment
		- Play with these so that it looks right
	- Drop egg.tscn's into the level
	- Create floors, walls, whatever. All these need to be a StaticBody3D for them to count as navigable tiles
	- Place whatever traps you deem fit

	- Double click the resource
	- Quick load the associated level
	- Add and set the appropriate number of traps the user is allowed for this level
