- Duplicate a Level scene (e.g. Level 1)
- Delete the Environment prefab in the scene
- Create a new Environment prefab (e.g. Environment 3) in Prefabs/Environments
- CREATE THE LEVEL
-- Jam things into the Environment prefab
-- Put eggs and traps in the scene
-- Add TurtleEscapers wherever you want the turtles to escape to (e.g. shorelines). Resize, duplicate as necessary
-- For controlling resources that the player has to complete the level, select the ManagersAndPlayer->Player. Modify trap count in the Player component

When done...
- Open the Environment prefab
- Select all ground tiles (i.e. tiles that you can place traps on) and set their layer to "Ground"
- Set Static for all children
- Select the top level Environment GameObject
- In the NavMeshSurface click "Bake"

When everything is done, add the Scene to File->Build Settings. Levels should be in ascending order from top to bottom
