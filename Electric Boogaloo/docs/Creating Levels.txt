- Create a scene under scenes/environments
	- Name it a number to denote which level it is. Starting from level 0
	- Place at least 1 shoreLine.tscn scene into the level. Reshapw, resize accordingly. The gizmo should show where the turtles will disappear when they touch. Turtles will path towards the center of this gizmo
	- Create a Camera3D, a DirectionalLight3D, and WorldEnvironment
		- Play with these so that it looks right
	- Drop egg.tscn's into the level
	- Create floors, walls, whatever. All these need to be a StaticBody3D for them to count as navigable tiles
	- Place whatever traps you deem fit
	
- Create a level resource under resources/level
	- Name it the same as the scene. This is important for sanity
	- Double click the resource
	- Quick load the associated level
	- Add and set the appropriate number of traps the user is allowed for this level
	
- Edit levels.tres
	- To add the level to the "list of levels", select the levels resource and add it to the Levels array
	- To test it out temporarily, set "Current Level Index" in Game.tscn's LevelLoader to the level and then Run Project (F5)
	- Set the level number back
